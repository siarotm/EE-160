#split() function
#this function splits strings on a delimeter(Default: space)

'''
str = 'Hello World! I have some experience programming now.'
x = str.split()
print(str)
print(x)
should print a list, each element each word (seperated by spaces)

print(str.split('e'))
this will print in a list, each element until an 'e' is reached (not including the 'e')
